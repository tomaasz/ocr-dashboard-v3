# Product Guidelines

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: The dashboard should be lightweight and easy to deploy on various hosts.
- **Reliability**: Auto-sync and service recovery are built-in to ensure high availability of the OCR farm.
- **Centralization**: Configuration should be centralized where possible (e.g., Global Source Directory, UI-based settings).

## Coding Standards
- Follow Python PEP 8.
- Ensure all new features have appropriate logging.
- Maintain compatibility with both Linux and Windows where applicable.
